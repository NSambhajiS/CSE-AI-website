It sounds like you have a clear vision for your project and a structured plan for how to approach the rebuild of the R&D project into the Krishna project. Hereâ€™s a proposed plan to systematically tackle the project, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize the `frontend` with React.
   - Initialize the `backend` with Node.js and Express.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication for both admin and faculty using JWT and bcrypt.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Implementing the UI**:
   - Ensure that the existing styles are preserved in the new components.
   - Use CSS modules or styled-components for better styling management.

5. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Implement the admin dashboard functionalities (add, edit, delete faculty, categories, etc.).
   - Implement the faculty dashboard functionalities (view, add, edit, delete their works).

6. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, test it thoroughly before moving on to the next.

### Code Style
- Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze them and ensure that the code generated follows the same style.

### Next Steps
1. **Share the Sample Files**: Please provide the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques that you want me to follow.
2. **Start with the First Functionality**: Once I have the sample files, we can begin with the first functionality, which could be setting up the project structure or implementing user authentication.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed or if you have any specific instructions or changes to this plan!
