Thank you for the detailed overview of your project and the specific requirements for the new "Krishna" project. It sounds like you have a clear vision for how you want to enhance and rebuild the existing "R&D" project. Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the development of the Krishna project:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Initialize a Node.js project in the `backend` folder.
   - Set up Express for routing.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt.
   - Set up Supabase for database management (PostgreSQL).
   - Create routes for admin and faculty login, registration, and CRUD operations for research data.

2. **Set Up the Frontend**:
   - Initialize a React project in the `frontend` folder.
   - Set up routing using React Router.
   - Create a main landing page with login options.
   - Create dynamic components for displaying faculty and category data.
   - Ensure the UI styles from the original project are maintained.

3. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Create a login page for both admin and faculty.
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.
   - Set up protected routes for admin and faculty dashboards.

4. **Dynamic Data Display**:
   - Create a single component for displaying faculty and category data dynamically using mapping.
   - Ensure that the sidebar for both admin and faculty dashboards is populated dynamically based on the data from the database.

5. **Admin Dashboard Functionality**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for managing faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Display totals and statistics on the admin dashboard.

6. **Faculty Dashboard Functionality**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for faculty to manage their own research data.
   - Allow faculty to edit their profile information.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test each functionality as it is implemented.
   - Ensure that all features work as expected and that the UI remains consistent.

### Code Style
Once you share the example files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze the code style and ensure that the code generated for the Krishna project adheres to that style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the example files for the code style you want to follow.
2. Once I have those, we can start with the first step: setting up the backend and initializing the Node.js project.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
