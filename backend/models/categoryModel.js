It sounds like you have a comprehensive plan for rebuilding your R&D project into the Krishna project with a more systematic approach and advanced techniques. Hereâ€™s a structured plan to guide us through the process step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a clear directory structure:
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, authentication, database interactions).
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, routing).

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create reusable components for faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Set up the project structure and initialize the backend and frontend.
   - **Step 2**: Implement user authentication (admin and faculty) with JWT and bcrypt.
   - **Step 3**: Create the dynamic components for faculty and categories.
   - **Step 4**: Implement the admin dashboard functionalities.
   - **Step 5**: Implement the faculty dashboard functionalities.
   - **Step 6**: Ensure all functionalities from the original project are intact and working.

### Code Style
5. **Code Style**: Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication, I will analyze them and ensure that the code generated for the Krishna project follows the same style.

### Next Steps
- Please share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication that you mentioned. Once I have those, I can start generating the updated code for the Krishna project step by step, ensuring that we maintain the visual styles from the original project while enhancing the functionality and structure.
