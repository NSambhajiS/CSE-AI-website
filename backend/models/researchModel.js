It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and the improvements you want to implement based on the existing "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan to proceed with the project, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects and overall architecture.

### Project Plan for Krishna Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create a new project folder with two main subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.
   - Initialize both folders with the necessary files and configurations.

2. **Backend Development**
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Integrate Supabase for PostgreSQL database management.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for:
     - Admin functionalities (add, edit, delete faculty, categories, etc.)
     - Faculty functionalities (view, add, edit, delete their research data).
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Set up a React application.
   - Use React Router for navigation between different pages (info page, admin dashboard, faculty dashboard).
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and category data dynamically.
   - Maintain the existing styles while enhancing the code structure.

4. **Dynamic Data Handling**
   - Implement mapping for faculty and categories to avoid creating separate components for each.
   - Ensure that the sidebar dynamically fetches and displays the necessary data.

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - After implementing each functionality, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
   - Validate user authentication and data handling.

6. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the application for deployment, ensuring all environment variables and configurations are set.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set Up Project Structure**
   - Create the main project folder and initialize `backend` and `frontend`.
   - Set up version control (e.g., Git) for tracking changes.

2. **Backend Setup**
   - Create a basic Express server.
   - Set up Supabase and connect it to the server.
   - Implement user authentication.

3. **Frontend Setup**
   - Create a React app using Create React App.
   - Set up routing and basic components.

4. **Implement Features One by One**
   - Start with user authentication.
   - Move on to admin functionalities.
   - Implement faculty functionalities.
   - Finally, work on dynamic data rendering.

### Code Style Reference
Please share the code files you mentioned (for React, Node, and authentication techniques) so I can analyze the style and ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project aligns with your expectations.

Once I have those files, we can begin with the first step of the implementation.
