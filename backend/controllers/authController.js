It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and a solid plan for how to improve upon the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured approach to how we can proceed with the rebuild, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the project.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Rebuilding the Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create a new project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Integrate Supabase for PostgreSQL database management.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Create routes for admin and faculty functionalities (login, CRUD operations for categories, faculties, and research data).

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React application inside the `frontend` folder.
   - Use React Router for navigation between different pages (info page, admin dashboard, faculty dashboard).
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and category data dynamically.
   - Maintain the existing styles while enhancing the code structure.

4. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Implement a mapping function to dynamically render faculty and category components instead of creating separate components for each.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After implementing each functionality, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
   - Fix any issues that arise during testing.

6. **Iterative Development**:
   - We will implement one functionality at a time, review it, and then proceed to the next.

### Initial Setup

Before we start coding, please share the style of code writing you want me to follow for React, Node, and authentication techniques. Once I have that, we can begin with the first step, which is setting up the project structure.

### Next Steps

1. **Share the Code Style**: Please provide the example files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. **Project Structure**: Once I have the style, I will guide you through creating the project structure and setting up the initial files.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
