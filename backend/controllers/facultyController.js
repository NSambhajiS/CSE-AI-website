It sounds like you have a comprehensive plan for rebuilding your R&D project into the Krishna project with a more systematic approach and advanced techniques. Hereâ€™s a structured plan to proceed with the project, along with the steps we will take to ensure everything is implemented correctly.

### Project Structure

1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Steps to Rebuild the Project

1. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Initialize a Node.js project in the `backend` folder.
   - Set up Express.js for routing.
   - Integrate Supabase for PostgreSQL database management.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt.
   - Create routes for admin and faculty functionalities.
   - Set up the database schema for faculties, categories, and research data.

2. **Set Up the Frontend**:
   - Initialize a React project in the `frontend` folder.
   - Set up routing using React Router.
   - Create a layout that includes the sidebar for both admin and faculty dashboards.
   - Implement dynamic rendering of faculty and category data using mapping techniques.
   - Ensure the UI styles from the original project are preserved.

3. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Create login components for both admin and faculty.
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.
   - Ensure password hashing and secure storage of user credentials.

4. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and category data.
   - Use state management (like Context API or Redux) to manage user sessions and data.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test each functionality as it is implemented.
   - Ensure that all features from the original project are intact and functioning correctly.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Prepare the application for deployment.
   - Choose a hosting service for the backend (like Heroku) and frontend (like Vercel or Netlify).

### Code Style Guidelines

Before we start coding, please share the example files for React, Node, and authentication techniques that you mentioned. This will help me understand your preferred coding style and conventions, ensuring that the code I generate aligns with your expectations.

### Next Steps

1. **Share the Example Files**: Please provide the example files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. **Confirm the Plan**: Let me know if you agree with the outlined plan or if there are any adjustments you would like to make.
3. **Start with the Backend**: Once I have the example files and your confirmation, we can begin with the backend setup.

Looking forward to your response!
