It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and how you want to improve upon the "R&D Project." To ensure we proceed systematically and effectively, let's outline a plan based on your requirements and the structure you want to implement.

### Project Plan for Krishna Project

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Integrate Supabase for database management (PostgreSQL).
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for:
     - Admin login
     - Faculty login
     - CRUD operations for faculties, categories, and research data.
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React application.
   - Use React Router for navigation between different pages (info page, admin dashboard, faculty dashboard).
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and category data dynamically.
   - Maintain the existing styles while enhancing the code structure.

4. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Use mapping to dynamically render faculty and category components instead of creating separate components for each.
   - Ensure that the sidebar for both admin and faculty dashboards fetches data dynamically.

5. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next feature.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the main project folder and subfolders.
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Set up the Express server and connect to Supabase.
   - Implement user authentication (admin and faculty).
   - Create API endpoints for CRUD operations.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Set up the React application.
   - Implement routing and create the necessary components.

4. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Implement dynamic rendering for faculty and category data.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test each functionality as we implement it.

### Next Steps

Before we start coding, please share the example files you mentioned for React, Node, and the authentication technique. This will help me understand your preferred coding style, and I can ensure that the code I generate aligns with that style.

Once I have those files, we can begin with the first step of setting up the project structure.
