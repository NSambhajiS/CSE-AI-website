It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and the improvements you want to implement over the "R&D Project." Here's a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuilding process, ensuring that we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the project.

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure:
   - `backend/` for Node.js and Express code.
   - `frontend/` for React code.
   - `public/` for static assets (if needed).
   - `config/` for configuration files (e.g., database connection).
   - `models/` for database models.
   - `routes/` for API routes.
   - `controllers/` for business logic.
   - `middleware/` for authentication and other middleware functions.

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for authentication.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Create separate authentication routes for admin and faculty.
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**: Create the folder structure as outlined above.
2. **Implement Authentication**: 
   - Set up user authentication with JWT and bcrypt.
   - Create routes for admin and faculty login.
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.
3. **Dynamic Component Creation**:
   - Create a generic component for faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render the data dynamically.
4. **Integrate Frontend and Backend**: Ensure that the frontend communicates with the backend API correctly.
5. **Testing**: After each step, we will test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected.
6. **Final Touches**: Review the project for any additional enhancements or optimizations.

### Code Style
Before we start coding, please share the sample files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you want me to follow. This will help me understand your preferred coding style, and I will ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project adheres to that style.

Once I have those samples, we can begin with the first step of setting up the project structure.
