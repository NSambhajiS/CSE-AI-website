It sounds like you have a well-defined plan for your project, and I appreciate the detailed description of the existing R&D project and your vision for the new Krishna project. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to how we can proceed with the rebuild:

### Step-by-Step Plan for Rebuilding the Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create a new project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty logins, as well as CRUD operations for faculties, categories, and research data.
   - Integrate Supabase for database management (PostgreSQL).
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React application inside the `frontend` folder.
   - Create a main landing page with login options.
   - Implement dynamic routing for faculty-wise and category-wise dashboards.
   - Use a single component to display faculty and category data dynamically.
   - Ensure that the UI styles from the original project are preserved or enhanced.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected.
   - Make adjustments based on testing feedback.

5. **Iterative Development**:
   - We will add one functionality at a time, ensuring that each part is functional before moving on to the next.

### Initial Setup

Before we start coding, please share the style of code writing you want me to follow for the React, Node, and authentication parts. Once I have that, we can begin with the first step: setting up the project structure and the backend server.

### Next Steps

1. **Share the Code Style**: Please provide the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques that represent the coding style you prefer.
2. **Confirm Project Structure**: Let me know if the proposed project structure meets your expectations or if you would like to make any adjustments.

Once I have this information, we can proceed with the implementation step by step.
