It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and a structured approach to rebuilding the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a proposed plan for how we can proceed step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic file structure with separate folders for `backend` and `frontend`.
   - `project-root/`
     - `backend/`
     - `frontend/`

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the necessary folders and files for both the backend and frontend.
   - Initialize the backend with Node.js and Express.
   - Initialize the frontend with React.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.
   - Create routes for admin and faculty login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Refactor the frontend to use dynamic components for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render components based on data fetched from the backend.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Create the admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Ensure that the admin can view totals for faculties, admins, and categories.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Create the faculty dashboard with functionalities to view, add, edit, and delete their research data.
   - Implement dynamic sidebar fetching categories.

6. **Styling**:
   - Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original project while enhancing it where necessary.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next step.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze the style and ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project follows the same conventions.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. Once I have those, I will generate the initial project structure and we can start implementing the first functionality.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
