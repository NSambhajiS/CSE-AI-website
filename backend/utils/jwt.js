Thank you for the detailed overview of your project and the specific requirements for the new "Krishna Project." It sounds like a comprehensive and well-structured plan to enhance the existing R&D project. Here's a proposed plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, authentication, database interactions).
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, routing).

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the main project folder and initialize `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - Set up package.json files for both backend and frontend.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.
   - Create routes for admin and faculty login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Refactor the existing components to use mapping for faculties and categories instead of creating separate components for each.
   - Create a template component that can render data dynamically based on props.

4. **Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Create separate dashboards for admin and faculty.
   - Implement the sidebar navigation dynamically based on user roles and data.

5. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for faculties, categories, and research data.
   - Ensure that the admin can manage all entities and faculty can manage their own data.

6. **Styling**:
   - Maintain the existing styles and responsiveness while enhancing the code structure.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next step.

### Code Style
- Before we start coding, please share the sample files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you mentioned. This will help me understand the coding style you prefer, and I will ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project follows that style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the sample files for the coding style.
2. Once I have those, we can begin with the first step: setting up the project structure.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
