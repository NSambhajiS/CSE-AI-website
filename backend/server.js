Thank you for the detailed overview of your project and the changes you want to implement. It sounds like a comprehensive and exciting project to work on! Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuilding of the R&D project into the Krishna project, step by step.

### Project Structure

1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Create the necessary folders and files for both the backend and frontend.
   - Initialize a Node.js project in the `backend` folder and a React project in the `frontend` folder.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for both admin and faculty logins.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render the data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Build the admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Ensure the admin can view totals for faculties, admins, and categories.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Create the faculty dashboard with functionalities to view, insert, edit, and delete their work.
   - Implement dynamic sidebar fetching for categories.

6. **Styling**:
   - Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original R&D project while enhancing it with advanced techniques.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next step.

### Code Style

Before we start coding, please share the sample files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you mentioned. This will help me understand the coding style you prefer, and I will ensure that the code generated for the Krishna project adheres to that style.

Once I have those samples, we can begin with the first step of setting up the project structure.
