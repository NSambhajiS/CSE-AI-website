It sounds like you have a clear vision for your project and the improvements you want to implement in the Krishna project. Here's a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database models, authentication, etc.)
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, etc.)

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for both admin and faculty logins.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create a single component for displaying faculty and categories dynamically using mapping instead of creating separate components for each.

### Functionality Breakdown
4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - We'll implement one functionality at a time, ensuring it works before moving on to the next.
   - Start with setting up the project structure and basic server setup.
   - Implement authentication.
   - Create dynamic components for faculty and categories.
   - Implement admin and faculty dashboards with the required functionalities.

### Code Style
5. **Code Style**:
   - Share the code samples for React, Node, and authentication techniques that you want me to follow.
   - I will analyze the provided code and ensure that the new code adheres to the same style.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
6. **Iterative Development**:
   - After each step, we will test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Once a feature is confirmed to be working, we will move on to the next feature.

### Next Steps
- Please share the code samples for React, Node, and authentication techniques that you want me to follow. Once I have those, I can start generating the updated code for the Krishna project in the same style.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed with the first step or if you have any additional instructions!
