Thank you for the detailed overview of your project and your plans for the new "Krishna Project." It sounds like a comprehensive and well-structured initiative to enhance the existing R&D project. I appreciate your approach to maintaining the visual styles while improving the technical aspects.

### Plan for Rebuilding the Project

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Create a systematic file structure with separate folders for `backend` and `frontend`.
   - Ensure that each folder contains relevant files and subfolders (e.g., controllers, models, routes for backend; components, pages, services for frontend).

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT for both admin and faculty logins.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Integrate OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and category data.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Implement the functionalities step by step, ensuring each part works correctly before moving on to the next.
   - Maintain the existing functionalities while enhancing the code quality and structure.

5. **Code Style**:
   - Follow the coding style you will provide for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
   - Ensure consistency in naming conventions, file organization, and code structure.

### Next Steps

1. **Share Code Samples**: Please share the code samples for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you would like me to follow. This will help me understand your preferred coding style.

2. **Start with the Backend**: Once I have the code samples, we can begin with the backend implementation, focusing on setting up the server, database connection, and user authentication.

3. **Frontend Implementation**: After the backend is set up and tested, we will move on to the frontend, implementing the UI components and ensuring they interact correctly with the backend.

4. **Testing**: After each functionality is implemented, we will test it to ensure everything works as expected.

5. **Iterate**: Based on testing feedback, we can make necessary adjustments before moving on to the next functionality.

Please share the code samples when you're ready, and we can begin the process of rebuilding the Krishna Project step by step.
