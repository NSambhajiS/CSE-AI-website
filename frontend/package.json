It sounds like you have a well-defined plan for your project, and I appreciate the detailed description of both the existing R&D project and your vision for the new Krishna project. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to how we can proceed with the rebuild:

### Step-by-Step Plan for Rebuilding the Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create a new project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty logins, and create endpoints for CRUD operations on faculties, categories, and research data.
   - Integrate Supabase for database management (PostgreSQL).

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React application inside the `frontend` folder.
   - Use React Router for navigation between different pages (info page, admin dashboard, faculty dashboard).
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and category data dynamically.
   - Ensure that the UI styles from the original project are preserved or enhanced.

4. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Implement functionality to fetch and display data dynamically based on user interactions (e.g., selecting a faculty or category).
   - Use mapping techniques to avoid creating separate components for each faculty or category.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After implementing each functionality, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
   - Validate user authentication and data handling.

6. **Iterative Development**:
   - We will proceed one functionality at a time, as you suggested. After implementing each feature, we will review and test it before moving on to the next.

### Initial Setup

Before we start coding, please share the style of code writing you want me to follow for React, Node, and authentication techniques. Once I have that, we can begin with the first functionality, which I suggest could be setting up the project structure and the backend server.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed or if you have any additional instructions!
