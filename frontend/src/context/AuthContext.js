Thank you for the detailed overview of your project and the specific requirements for the new "Krishna Project." It sounds like a comprehensive and well-structured plan to enhance the existing R&D project while maintaining its visual appeal. 

### Plan for Rebuilding the Project

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Create a systematic file management structure with separate folders for `backend` and `frontend`.
   - Ensure that each folder contains relevant files and subfolders (e.g., controllers, models, routes for backend; components, pages, styles for frontend).

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication for both admin and faculty logins using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Add OAuth functionality for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Refactor the existing components to use a mapping approach for rendering faculty and categories dynamically instead of creating separate components for each.

4. **Maintain UI/UX**:
   - Keep the existing styles and responsive design intact while enhancing the code structure and functionality.

5. **Step-by-Step Implementation**:
   - We will implement one functionality at a time, test it, and then proceed to the next. This will ensure that we can catch any issues early in the process.

### Next Steps

1. **Share Code Samples**:
   - Please share the code samples for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you would like me to follow. This will help me understand your preferred coding style.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - Once I have the code samples, I will guide you through setting up the project structure and the initial files for both the backend and frontend.

3. **Implement User Authentication**:
   - After the initial setup, we will implement the user authentication system.

4. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Next, we will refactor the components to render dynamically based on the data.

5. **Testing**:
   - After each step, we will test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected.

Please go ahead and share the code samples, and we can start the process of rebuilding the Krishna Project step by step.
