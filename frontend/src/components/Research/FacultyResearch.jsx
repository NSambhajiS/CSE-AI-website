It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and a solid plan to enhance and rebuild the existing "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured approach to how we can proceed with the project, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database models, authentication).
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, routing).

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Functionality Breakdown
4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - We will implement one functionality at a time, ensuring it works before moving on to the next.
   - Each functionality will be tested thoroughly.

### Code Style
5. **Code Style**:
   - You will provide examples of the code style you want to follow for React, Node, and authentication.
   - I will adhere to this style in all code generated for the Krishna Project.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**: Create the `backend` and `frontend` folders.
2. **Implement Authentication**: Set up user authentication with JWT, bcrypt, and OAuth.
3. **Create Dynamic Components**: Develop components for faculty and categories that can render dynamically.
4. **Implement Admin Dashboard**: Create the admin dashboard with functionalities to manage faculties and categories.
5. **Implement Faculty Dashboard**: Create the faculty dashboard with functionalities to manage their own data.
6. **Testing and Debugging**: Test each functionality as we implement it to ensure everything works as expected.
7. **Styling**: Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original project while enhancing it where necessary.

### Next Steps
- Please share the code samples for React, Node, and authentication techniques that you want me to follow. Once I have those, we can start with the first step: setting up the project structure. 

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
