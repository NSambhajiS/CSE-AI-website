It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and how you want to improve upon the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, step by step, while maintaining the existing UI styles and functionalities.

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure:
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database interactions).
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React, EJS, styles).

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create reusable components for faculties and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the `backend` and `frontend` folders.
   - Initialize Node.js in the `backend` folder and set up Express.
   - Initialize React in the `frontend` folder.

2. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Set up user authentication for admin and faculty.
   - Implement password hashing and JWT for secure login.
   - Add Google OAuth for additional login options.

3. **Dynamic Component Creation**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use props and mapping to render data dynamically.

4. **Integrate UI**:
   - Ensure that the existing styles are preserved while integrating the new components.
   - Test responsiveness and visual consistency.

5. **Functionality Testing**:
   - After implementing each feature, test it thoroughly before moving on to the next.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze them and ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project follows the same style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. Once I have those, I will generate the initial code for setting up the project structure.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
