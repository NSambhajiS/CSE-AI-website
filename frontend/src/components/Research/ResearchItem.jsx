It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and how you want to improve upon the existing "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan to proceed with the rebuild, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the project.

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize the backend with Node.js and Express.
   - Initialize the frontend with React.
   - Set up Supabase for database management.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication for both admin and faculty using JWT and bcrypt.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Create separate dashboards for admin and faculty.
   - Implement sidebar navigation for both dashboards.

5. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for admin (adding/editing/deleting faculty, categories).
   - Implement CRUD operations for faculty (adding/editing/deleting their work).

6. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, test to ensure everything works as expected.

### Code Style
Before we start coding, please share the example files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you want me to follow. This will help me understand your preferred coding style and conventions.

### Next Steps
1. **Share the Example Files**: Please provide the example files for the coding style.
2. **Confirm the Plan**: Let me know if you agree with the outlined plan or if there are any adjustments you would like to make.
3. **Start with the First Functionality**: Once I have the example files and your confirmation, we can begin with the first functionality, which is setting up the project structure.

Looking forward to your response!
