It sounds like you have a well-defined plan for your project, and I appreciate the detailed overview of the existing R&D project and your vision for the new Krishna project. Here’s a structured approach to how we can proceed with the rebuilding of your project step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**: Create a main project folder with two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.
   - `backend`: This will contain all server-side code (Node.js, Express, authentication, database interactions).
   - `frontend`: This will contain all client-side code (React components, styles, etc.).

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the folder structure as mentioned above.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` folder and a new React app in the `frontend` folder.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty login, including OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Implement the admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Ensure that the admin can view totals for each category and faculty.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Implement the faculty dashboard with functionalities to view, add, edit, and delete their research data.
   - Ensure that the sidebar dynamically fetches category types.

6. **Styling**:
   - Maintain the existing styles from the R&D project while enhancing them where necessary.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next step.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication, I will analyze them to understand your preferred coding style. After that, I will generate the updated code for each functionality in the same style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication.
2. Once I have those, I will provide the updated code for the first step, which is setting up the project structure.

Let me know when you’re ready to proceed!
