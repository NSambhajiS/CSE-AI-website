It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and how you want to improve upon the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure:
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, etc.)
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React, EJS, etc.)

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create reusable components for faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Functionality Breakdown
4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Start with the landing page and user authentication.
   - Implement the admin dashboard functionalities.
   - Implement the faculty dashboard functionalities.
   - Ensure that all functionalities from the R&D project are retained and improved.

### Code Style
5. **Code Style**:
   - Share the code snippets you want me to learn from for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
   - I will ensure that the code generated follows the same style throughout the project.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
6. **Step-by-Step Approach**:
   - We will implement one functionality at a time.
   - After each implementation, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next functionality.

### Next Steps
- Please share the code snippets for the React, Node, and authentication techniques that you want me to follow. Once I have those, we can start with the first functionality, which I suggest could be setting up the project structure and the landing page.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
