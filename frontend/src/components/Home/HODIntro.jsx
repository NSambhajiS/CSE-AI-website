It sounds like you have a comprehensive plan for rebuilding your R&D project into the Krishna project with a more systematic approach and advanced techniques. Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the project, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**: Create a main project folder with two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.
   - `backend`: This will contain all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database interactions).
   - `frontend`: This will contain all client-side code (React components, styles, etc.).

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the folder structure as described above.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` folder and a new React app in the `frontend` folder.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty login.
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Create an admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Implement profile editing for the admin.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Create a faculty dashboard that displays their research data.
   - Implement functionalities for faculty to add, edit, and delete their work.

6. **Responsive UI**:
   - Ensure that the UI remains responsive and retains the styles from the original project.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next feature.

### Code Style
You mentioned that you would share a file for each part of the project (React, Node, authentication) to establish a coding style. Once you share those files, I will analyze them and ensure that the code I generate for the Krishna project adheres to that style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the files that demonstrate the coding style you want to use for the Krishna project.
2. Once I have those files, I will begin generating the updated code step by step, starting with the project structure.
