Thank you for the detailed description of your project and your vision for the new "Krishna" project. It sounds like a comprehensive and well-structured plan to enhance the existing "R&D" project. Hereâ€™s a proposed plan for how we can proceed with the rebuilding process step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database models, authentication, etc.)
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the folder structure as described above.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` folder and a React app in the `frontend` folder.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty login, including OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Build the admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Display totals for faculties, admins, and categories.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Create the faculty dashboard to display their research data.
   - Implement functionalities for faculty to insert, edit, and delete their work.

6. **Styling**:
   - Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original project while enhancing it with advanced techniques.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next feature.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze them to understand your preferred coding style. After that, I will generate the updated code for the Krishna project in the same style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. Once I have those, I will begin with the first step: setting up the project structure.

Let me know if you have any additional instructions or modifications to this plan!
