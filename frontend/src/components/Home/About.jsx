It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and want to enhance the existing "R&D Project" while maintaining its visual styles. Hereâ€™s a structured plan to proceed with the project rebuild, focusing on the enhancements and systematic approaches you mentioned:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a structured folder layout:
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, authentication, etc.)
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React, EJS, styles, etc.)

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Create separate authentication routes for admin and faculty, along with OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Component Rendering
3. **Dynamic Components**:
   - Instead of creating separate components for each faculty and category, create a generic component that can render data based on props.
   - Use mapping to dynamically generate the UI based on the data fetched from the database.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the `backend` and `frontend` folders.
   - Initialize Node.js in the `backend` folder and set up Express.
   - Initialize React in the `frontend` folder.

2. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Set up user registration and login routes in the backend.
   - Implement JWT and bcrypt for secure authentication.
   - Create a login page in the frontend for both admin and faculty.

3. **Dynamic Data Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and category data.
   - Fetch data from the backend and pass it to the component using props.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Create routes for admin functionalities (add/edit/delete faculty, categories, etc.).
   - Implement the admin dashboard UI.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Create routes for faculty functionalities (view/edit their work).
   - Implement the faculty dashboard UI.

6. **Testing**:
   - After each step, test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze them and ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project follows the same style.

### Next Steps
Please share the sample files for the code style you want to follow, and we can start with the first step of setting up the project structure. After that, we can proceed to implement the authentication functionality.
