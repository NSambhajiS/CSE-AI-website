It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and the improvements you want to implement based on the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, ensuring that we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the project.

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize the `frontend` with React.
   - Initialize the `backend` with Node.js and Express.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication for both admin and faculty using JWT and bcrypt.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a single component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Implementing Functionalities**:
   - Start with the landing page and login functionalities.
   - Implement the admin dashboard functionalities.
   - Implement the faculty dashboard functionalities.
   - Ensure that all CRUD operations for research data are functional.

5. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next feature.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze them and ensure that the code I generate follows the same style throughout the project.

### Next Steps
1. **Share the Sample Files**: Please provide the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. **Confirm the Project Structure**: Let me know if you agree with the proposed project structure and plan.
3. **Start with the First Functionality**: Once I have the samples and your confirmation, we can begin with the first functionality, which will likely be setting up the project structure and the landing page.

Feel free to provide any additional details or modifications to the plan!
