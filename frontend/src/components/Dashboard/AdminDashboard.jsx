It sounds like you have a clear vision for your project and a structured plan for how to proceed with the rebuild. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how we can approach the Krishna project, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the application.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Rebuilding the Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create a new project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Integrate Supabase for PostgreSQL database management.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Create routes for admin and faculty functionalities (login, CRUD operations for categories, faculties, and research data).

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React application inside the `frontend` folder.
   - Use EJS for server-side rendering where necessary.
   - Implement dynamic components for displaying faculty and category data using mapping techniques.
   - Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original R&D project.

4. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement login functionality for both admin and faculty.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.
   - Ensure secure password storage and management.

5. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and category data.
   - Use state management (like React Context or Redux) to manage user sessions and data.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test each functionality as it is implemented.
   - Ensure that the UI remains responsive and visually consistent with the original project.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Prepare the application for deployment (consider using platforms like Vercel for the frontend and Heroku for the backend).

### Initial Steps

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Create the project folder and subfolders.
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Set up a basic Express server in the `backend` folder.
   - Install necessary packages (e.g., `express`, `pg`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, etc.).

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Create a new React app in the `frontend` folder using Create React App.
   - Install necessary packages (e.g., `axios` for API calls, `react-router-dom` for routing).

### Code Style Reference

Before we start generating code, please share the reference files you mentioned for the React, Node, and authentication techniques. This will help me understand your preferred coding style and ensure that the code I generate aligns with your expectations.

Once I have those reference files, we can proceed with the first functionality, starting with the backend setup or any other part you prefer. Let me know how you would like to proceed!
