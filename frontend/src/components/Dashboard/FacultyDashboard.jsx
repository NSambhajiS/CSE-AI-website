It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and how you want to enhance and rebuild the existing "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the development of the new project, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database models, authentication, etc.)
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, etc.)

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create reusable components for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Functionality Breakdown
4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Implement one functionality at a time, ensuring it works before moving on to the next.
   - Start with the authentication system.
   - Then move on to the dynamic rendering of faculty and categories.
   - Finally, implement the admin and faculty dashboards.

### Code Style
5. **Code Style**:
   - Share the code samples for React, Node, and authentication techniques that you want me to follow.
   - I will ensure that the code generated adheres to the style you provide.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
6. **Step-by-Step Approach**:
   - After you share the code samples, we will start with the first functionality (e.g., setting up the backend with Express and PostgreSQL).
   - Once that is complete and verified, we will proceed to the next functionality (e.g., implementing user authentication).
   - We will continue this process until the project is fully rebuilt.

### Next Steps
- Please share the code samples for the React component, Node.js backend, and authentication technique that you want me to follow.
- Once I have those samples, we can begin the implementation process step by step.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
