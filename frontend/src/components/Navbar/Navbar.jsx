It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and how you want to improve upon the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan to proceed with the project, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects.

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` folder.
   - Set up a React app in the `frontend` folder using Create React App.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for both admin and faculty logins.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Backend API Development**:
   - Set up Express routes for handling authentication, faculty data, and category data.
   - Connect to Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data storage and retrieval.

5. **Frontend Development**:
   - Implement the UI using React, ensuring to maintain the existing styles.
   - Use React Router for navigation between different pages (info page, admin dashboard, faculty dashboard).

6. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - After implementing each functionality, test it thoroughly.
   - Make adjustments as necessary based on testing feedback.

### Code Style
Before we start coding, please share the example files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you want me to follow. This will help me understand your preferred coding style and conventions.

### Next Steps
Once you provide the example files, we can begin with the first step of setting up the project structure. After that, we can move on to implementing user authentication, followed by dynamic component rendering, and so on.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
