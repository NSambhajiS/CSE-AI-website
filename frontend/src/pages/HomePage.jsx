It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and the improvements you want to implement based on the existing "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the project.

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize the `backend` folder with Node.js and Express.
   - Initialize the `frontend` folder with React.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for both admin and faculty logins.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Create separate dashboards for admin and faculty.
   - Implement sidebar navigation for both dashboards.

5. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for admin to manage faculties and categories.
   - Implement CRUD operations for faculties to manage their research data.

6. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next feature.

### Code Style
Before we start coding, please share the sample files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you want me to follow. This will help me understand your preferred coding style and conventions.

### Next Steps
1. **Share the Sample Files**: Please provide the sample files for the coding style you want to maintain.
2. **Confirm the Plan**: Let me know if you agree with the outlined plan or if there are any adjustments you would like to make.

Once I have the sample files and your confirmation, we can start with the first step of setting up the project structure.
