It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and a solid plan for how to improve upon the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured approach to how we can proceed with the rebuild, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the project.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Rebuilding the Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create a new project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty logins, as well as CRUD operations for faculties, categories, and research data.
   - Integrate Supabase for PostgreSQL database management.
   - Implement OAuth for Google login.

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React application inside the `frontend` folder.
   - Create a main layout that includes the sidebar for navigation.
   - Implement dynamic rendering of faculty and category data using mapping techniques.
   - Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original project styles.

4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Start with user authentication and ensure it works correctly.
   - Implement the admin dashboard functionalities.
   - Implement the faculty dashboard functionalities.
   - Ensure that all CRUD operations are functional for both admin and faculty users.
   - Test each functionality thoroughly before moving on to the next.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - After implementing each functionality, conduct tests to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Debug any issues that arise during testing.

6. **Final Review and Deployment**:
   - Review the entire project for any inconsistencies or bugs.
   - Prepare the project for deployment.

### Code Style Guidelines
Before we start generating code, please share the sample files you mentioned for React, Node, and authentication techniques. This will help me understand your preferred coding style, and I will ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project adheres to that style.

Once I have those samples, we can begin with the first functionality, starting with the project structure setup and backend development. Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
