It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and a structured approach to rebuilding the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a proposed plan to proceed with the project step by step, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize the backend with Node.js and Express.
   - Initialize the frontend with React.
   - Set up Supabase for database management.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication for both admin and faculty using JWT and bcrypt.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Create separate dashboards for admin and faculty.
   - Implement sidebar navigation for both dashboards.

5. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for admin to manage faculties and categories.
   - Implement CRUD operations for faculty to manage their own research data.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test each functionality as it is implemented to ensure everything works as expected.

7. **Styling**:
   - Ensure that the styles from the original project are preserved or enhanced as needed.

### Code Style Reference
Before we start coding, please share the reference files for React, Node, and the authentication technique. This will help me understand your preferred coding style, and I will ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project adheres to that style.

Once I have the reference files, we can begin with the first step: setting up the project structure.
