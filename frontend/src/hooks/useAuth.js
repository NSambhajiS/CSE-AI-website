It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and the improvements you want to make over the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, ensuring we maintain the existing UI styles while enhancing the technical aspects of the project.

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (via Supabase), Bcrypt, JWT
- **Frontend**: React, EJS, ES6

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Setup Project Structure**:
   - Initialize the backend and frontend folders.
   - Set up package.json files for both backend and frontend.
   - Install necessary dependencies for both parts.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication for both admin and faculty using JWT and Bcrypt.
   - Add OAuth for Google login.
   - Create routes for login, registration, and profile management.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Create separate dashboards for admin and faculty.
   - Implement sidebar navigation that fetches data dynamically.

5. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for admin to manage faculties and categories.
   - Implement CRUD operations for faculties to manage their own research data.

6. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected.

7. **Styling**:
   - Ensure that the styles from the original project are preserved or enhanced as needed.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze them and ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project follows the same style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. Once I have those, I will generate the initial setup code for the project structure and we can proceed from there.

Let me know when you're ready to move forward!
