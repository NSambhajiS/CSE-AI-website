It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and want to improve upon the existing "R&D Project" by implementing a more systematic approach and utilizing advanced techniques. Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the project:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a main project folder named `krishna-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize the backend with Node.js and Express.
   - Initialize the frontend with React.
   - Ensure that the folder structure is clear and organized.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.
   - Create routes for admin and faculty login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Create an admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete admins, faculties, and categories.
   - Display totals of faculties, admins, and categories.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Create a faculty dashboard that allows faculty members to view and manage their research data.
   - Implement functionalities to insert, edit, and delete their work.

6. **Styling**:
   - Maintain the existing styles from the R&D project.
   - Enhance styles where necessary using advanced CSS techniques.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, test it thoroughly before moving on to the next step.

### Code Style
- Before we start coding, please share the sample files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you mentioned. This will help me understand the coding style you prefer, and I will ensure that the code generated for the Krishna Project adheres to that style.

### Next Steps
- Once I receive the sample files, I will begin with the first step of setting up the project structure and provide you with the initial code. After that, we can proceed with implementing user authentication.

Please share the sample files when you're ready, and we can get started!
