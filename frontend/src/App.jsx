It sounds like you have a clear vision for the "Krishna Project" and how you want to improve upon the "R&D Project." Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the rebuild, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure:
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database models, authentication, etc.)
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, etc.)

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create reusable components for faculties and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Functionality Breakdown
4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Implement the landing page with basic info and login options.
   - Create the admin dashboard with functionalities to manage faculties and categories.
   - Create the faculty dashboard with functionalities to manage their own research data.
   - Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original project.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
5. **Step-by-Step Approach**:
   - We will implement one functionality at a time.
   - After each implementation, we will test to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next functionality.

### Code Style
6. **Code Style**:
   - You will provide example files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
   - I will follow the same coding style in the new project.

### Next Steps
- Please share the example files for React, Node, and authentication techniques so I can understand the coding style you prefer.
- Once I have those, we can start with the first functionality, which could be setting up the project structure and the landing page.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
