It sounds like you have a well-defined plan for your project, and I appreciate the detailed overview of the existing R&D project and your vision for the new Krishna project. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to how we can proceed with the rebuild:

### Step-by-Step Plan for Rebuilding the Krishna Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create a new project folder with a systematic file structure.
   - Inside the main project folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty logins, as well as CRUD operations for faculties, categories, and research data.
   - Integrate Supabase for database management (PostgreSQL).

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up a React application.
   - Create a main landing page with login options.
   - Implement dynamic routing for faculty-wise and category-wise research data display.
   - Use a single component to render faculty and category data dynamically based on the data fetched from the backend.

4. **Styling**:
   - Maintain the existing styles from the R&D project.
   - Enhance styles where necessary using advanced techniques (e.g., CSS modules, styled-components).

5. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
   - Fix any issues that arise during testing.

6. **Iterative Development**:
   - Add one functionality at a time, as you suggested.
   - After each addition, we will review and test before moving on to the next feature.

### Initial Setup

Before we start coding, please share the sample files you mentioned for React, Node, and authentication techniques. This will help me understand your preferred coding style and conventions. Once I have those, we can begin with the first step of setting up the project structure. 

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
