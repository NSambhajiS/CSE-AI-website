It sounds like you have a comprehensive plan for rebuilding your R&D project into the Krishna project with a more systematic approach and advanced techniques. Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the project, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**: Create a main project folder with two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.
   - `backend`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, authentication, database interactions).
   - `frontend`: Contains all client-side code (React components, styles, routing).

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the folder structure as described.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` folder and a React app in the `frontend` folder.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up routes for admin and faculty login, including OAuth for Google login.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Set up the admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Ensure that the admin can view totals for each category and faculty.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Implement the faculty dashboard where faculty can view their work, edit their profiles, and manage their submissions.

6. **Styling**:
   - Maintain the existing styles from the R&D project while enhancing the code structure and functionality.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next feature.

### Code Style
- Before we start coding, please share the sample files for React, Node, and the authentication technique that you want me to follow. This will help me understand your preferred coding style and conventions.

### Next Steps
1. **Share the Sample Files**: Please provide the sample files for React, Node, and authentication.
2. **Confirm the Plan**: Let me know if you agree with the outlined plan or if there are any adjustments you would like to make.
3. **Start Coding**: Once I have the samples and your confirmation, we can begin coding the first functionality.

Feel free to share any additional details or requirements you have in mind!
