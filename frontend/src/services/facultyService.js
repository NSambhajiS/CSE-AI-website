It sounds like you have a comprehensive plan for rebuilding your R&D project into the Krishna project with a more systematic approach and advanced techniques. Hereâ€™s a structured plan for how we can proceed with the project, step by step:

### Project Structure
1. **Folder Structure**: Create a main project folder with two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.
   - `backend`: This will contain all the Node.js and Express-related code.
   - `frontend`: This will contain all the React-related code.

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Create the folder structure as mentioned above.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` folder and a new React app in the `frontend` folder.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for both admin and faculty logins.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.
   - Create routes for login and registration in the backend.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering**:
   - Create a generic component for displaying faculty and categories.
   - Use mapping to render the data dynamically instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Create an admin dashboard with functionalities to add, edit, and delete faculties, categories, and admins.
   - Implement the necessary API endpoints in the backend.

5. **Faculty Dashboard**:
   - Create a faculty dashboard that displays their research data and allows them to manage their entries.
   - Implement the necessary API endpoints in the backend.

6. **Styling**:
   - Ensure that the UI remains consistent with the original project while enhancing it where necessary.

7. **Testing**:
   - After implementing each functionality, we will test it to ensure it works as expected before moving on to the next step.

### Code Style
Once you share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques, I will analyze them to understand your preferred coding style. After that, I will generate the updated code for the Krishna project in the same style.

### Next Steps
1. Please share the sample files for React, Node, and authentication techniques.
2. Once I have those, I will provide the code for the first step: setting up the project structure.
