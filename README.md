### Project Structure
1. **File Management**: Create a systematic folder structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - `backend/`: Contains all server-side code (Node.js, Express, database interactions).
   - `frontend/`: Contains all client-side code (React, EJS, styles).

### Authentication
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for session management.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Set up OAuth for Google login.

### Dynamic Components
3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Create reusable components for faculties and categories.
   - Use mapping to dynamically render data instead of creating separate components for each faculty/category.

### Functionality Breakdown
4. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Start with the basic landing page and user authentication.
   - Implement the admin dashboard functionalities.
   - Implement the faculty dashboard functionalities.
   - Ensure all functionalities from the R&D project are intact.

### Code Style
5. **Code Style**: 
   - Share the code snippets for React, Node, and authentication techniques that you want me to follow. I will analyze these styles and ensure that the new code adheres to them.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
6. **Iterative Development**:
   - We will implement one functionality at a time, test it, and then move on to the next.
   - After each implementation, we will review the code and ensure it works as expected.

### Next Steps
- Please share the code snippets for the React component, Node.js backend, and authentication technique that you want me to follow. Once I have those, I can start generating the updated code for the Krishna project in the same style.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed with the first step, and feel free to share the code snippets!
